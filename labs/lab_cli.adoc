## PKS Workshop Lab 1
This is a sample SpringBoot application that performs Geo Bounded queries against an Elastic Search instance and plots the data on a map interactively. This application can be run on a workstation or in a cloud environment such as Cloud Foundry. In this example, I will show how to deploy the application on a running Cloud Foundry instance.

### 1. Install and Setup CLIs
#### Install PKS CLI
In order to install the PKS CLI please follow these instructions: https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/1-3/installing-pks-cli.html. Note, you will need to register with network.pivotal.io in order to download the CLI.

Download from: https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service/

#### Install kubectl CLI
You can install the kubectl CLI from PivNet as well, https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-container-service

What you download is the executable. After downloading, rename the file to `kubectl`, move it to where you like and make sure it's in your path.

For reference, here are some other ways to install, https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl

### 2. Cluster Access and Validation
#### Get Cluster Credentials
You will need to retrieve the cluster credentials from PKS. First login using the the PKS credentials that were provided to you for this lab exercise.
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 pks login -a api.ws.pks101.com -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -k
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can retrive your Kubernetes cluster credentials. Please use the cluster name that was provided to you for this lab exercise.
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME
---------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Validating your Cluster
Ensure that you can access the API Endpoints on the Master
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 kubectl cluster-info
---------------------------------------------------------------------


You should see something similar to the following:
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 Kubernetes master is running at https://workshop.clusters.pks.cfrocket.com:8443
 Heapster is running at https://workshop.clusters.pks.cfrocket.com:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/heapster/proxy
 KubeDNS is running at https://workshop.clusters.pks.cfrocket.com:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
 kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://workshop.clusters.pks.cfrocket.com:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy
 monitoring-influxdb is running at https://workshop.clusters.pks.cfrocket.com:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/monitoring-influxdb/proxy
---------------------------------------------------------------------


#### Accessing the Dashboard

To access Dashboard from your local workstation you must create a secure channel to your Kubernetes cluster. Run the following command:

[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 kubectl proxy
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Now access Dashboard at:

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/.

When prompted for choosing either the Kubeconfig or Token, choose Kubeconfig.  You will need to browse to HOME-DIR/.kube and select the file named `config`.

On Windows, you may want to use Firefox or Chrome as Explorer has some issues.

If for some reason you are not able to pick the config file, you can also use Token. Find `id-token` of your user from `HOME-DIR/.kube/config` file and copy paste the token.

#### Setting the namespace preference
You can permanently save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands in that context.
[source,bash]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=YOUR-NAMESPACE
# Validate it
$ kubectl config view | grep namespace:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
